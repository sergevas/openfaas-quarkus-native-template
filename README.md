## Template: openfaas-quarkus-native-template

The [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) template uses maven as a build system.

The template makes use of the OpenFAAS incubator project [of-watchdog](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/of-watchdog).

Quarkus is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards. The very nature of the project makes it a perfect fit for serverless too. This template is a barebores quarkus template you would generate from:

```bash
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:0.12.0:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=function \
    -DclassName="org.acme.quickstart.GreetingResource" \
    -Dpath="/"
```

Packaged as a template to quickly be deployed on OpenFAAS. This means that all the official features and extensions can be used out of the box in your functions too.

### Structure

This a template showcasing the use of Native Quarkus as a viable runtime for Serverless functions.

Functions are pure `JAX-RS` routes: 

```java
@Path("/function")
public class GreetingResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "hello OpenFaaS";
    }
}
```

This template is not different than a regular Qaurkus application, all features you could use with Quarkus can be used here too.

To get started with Qaurkus, please read the official [Getting Started Guide](https://quarkus.io/get-started/).

### Using extensions

Quarkus has several [extensions](https://quarkus.io/extensions/) available. They can be used with this template using the standard mechanisms:

```bash
# See the available extensions
$ mvn quarkus:list-extensions
# Add a specific extension
$ mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="groupId:artifactId"
```

To conclude, using Quarkus for serverless is exactly the same as using quarkus for regular applications. 


### Trying the template

```
$ faas-cli template pull https://github.com/pmlopes/openfaas-quarkus-native-template
$ faas-cli new --lang quarkus-native <fn-name>
```

### Building

When working in development mode, the java application is build as usual:

```
mvn clean package quarkus:dev
```

When going to OpenFAAS, the build is run inside a Docker container using the provided `Dockerfile`.

The Dockerfile performs the following actions:

1. Builds the Java code
2. Generates a native image from the fat jar
3. Creates a new image and install OpenFAAS of-watchdog
4. Copies the native image to the new container
5. Configures the watchdog

You can also run the Dockerfile locally:

```
docker build -t my-quarkus-fn .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 my-quarkus-fn
```

You can observe instant startup times and low memory usage:

```

Remember that the memory usage in this case accounts for both the vert.x application and the watchdog!
